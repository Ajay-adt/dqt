## Documentation for Databricks notebook template for creating mkdocs index.md files based on DQ output

This notebook template automates the process of generating mkdocs index.md files based on the results of your Databricks data quality (DQ) checks. It leverages Great Expectations to define and run expectations against your data, and then creates a report summarizing the results.

## Key functionalities:

* **Parses DQ output:** Reads the output of your DQ checks (assumed to be in JSON format) and converts it to a Python object for further processing.
* **Sets up Azure Blob Storage and Data Docs site:** Configures the necessary resources on Azure Blob Storage to store the generated mkdocs site and integrates it with Data Docs for visualization.
* **Defines custom expectations:** Allows you to define custom expectations in YAML format and add them to an expectation suite for specific DQ checks.
* **Builds and runs batch request:** Creates a batch request based on your data source and chosen expectations, and executes the validation against your data.
* **Creates checkpoint and sends notification:** Creates a checkpoint to save the validation results and sends notifications based on the outcome (e.g., via Microsoft Teams).
* **Logs details to database:** Records information about the DQ check run and its results to a database table for further analysis.

## Input requirements:

* **Databricks notebook:** This template is designed to run within a Databricks notebook environment.
* **DQ output:** The notebook expects your DQ checks to generate JSON output containing details about the validation results.
* **Azure Blob Storage credentials:** You need to provide access credentials for the Azure Blob Storage container where you want to store the generated mkdocs site.
* **Data Docs configuration:** Configure your Data Docs site with the appropriate information to connect to Azure Blob Storage.
* **Custom expectations (optional):** If you want to define custom expectations beyond the pre-defined ones, you need to provide a YAML file containing your expectation definitions.

## Output:

* **mkdocs index.md file:** The notebook generates an index.md file for your Data Docs site, summarizing the results of your DQ checks.
* **Checkpoint:** A checkpoint is created in your Great Expectations context to store the validation results for further reference.
* **Database log (optional):** The notebook can optionally log details about the DQ check run and its results to a database table.

## Security considerations:

* This template currently stores Azure Blob Storage and GXLOG database connection strings as variables within the notebook. It's recommended to use Secret Management Vault or Databricks Secrets for secure storage and access to these credentials.

## Limitations and improvements:

* The template is currently designed for DQ outputs in JSON format. Adapting it to other output formats might require modifications.
* Some parts of the notebook could benefit from more refined error handling for robustness.
* Adding comments throughout the notebook would significantly improve its readability and understandability for future users.
* Consider making the template more modular for wider use with different DQ outputs and customization options.

**Overall, this template provides a powerful foundation for automating DQ reporting in Databricks. With further refinement and security considerations, it can be a valuable tool for ensuring data quality and transparency within your data pipelines.**

## Additional notes:

* This documentation is a general overview, and specific details about the notebook implementation may vary.
* Feel free to ask any questions or request further explanations about any part of the template.

I hope this documentation provides a clearer understanding of the functionalities and purpose of the notebook template. Please let me know if you have any further questions!
